//slice of slices can contain any type, including other slices.
//append function is used to append elements to a slice.
//If the backing array of s is too small to fit all the given values a bigger array will be allocated.
//The returned slice will point to the newly allocated array.
//range form of the for loop iterates over a slice or map.
//When ranging over a slice, two values are returned for each iteration. The first is the index, and the second is a copy of the element at that index.
//You can skip the index or value by assigning to _.
//If you only want the index, drop the ", value" entirely.
